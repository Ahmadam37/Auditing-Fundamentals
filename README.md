# Auditing-Fundamentals
Understanding security auditing is crucial for penetration testers, as it provides the expertise needed to assess and strengthen an organization’s security posture. Security audits follow a structured approach to identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, and implementing industry best practices.





Essential Termonology:

# 🔍 Types of Security Audits

Understanding the different types of security audits helps organizations select the right approach based on their needs and compliance obligations.

---

## 🏢 Internal Audit

- **Objective:**  
  Evaluate the organization's internal security policies, processes, and controls.

- **Importance:**  
  Enables early detection of security gaps and non-compliance before external review.

- **Example:**  
  Regular quarterly audits by the internal IT/security team to review access controls and incident response readiness.

---

## 🌐 External Audit

- **Objective:**  
  Provide an independent assessment of the organization's security posture.

- **Importance:**  
  Builds trust with stakeholders, customers, and regulators; often required for certifications.

- **Example:**  
  A third-party firm conducting an annual ISO 27001 audit or a penetration test.

---

## 📜 Compliance Audit

- **Objective:**  
  Verify adherence to regulatory or industry-specific standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).

- **Importance:**  
  Avoid legal penalties, maintain certifications, and ensure data protection.

- **Example:**  
  An audit to confirm that personal data handling complies with GDPR requirements.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Audit

- **Objective:**  
  Assess the security of systems, applications, source code, and infrastructure.

- **Importance:**  
  Identifies technical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insecure coding practices.

- **Example:**  
  Static code analysis or security review of infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations.

---

## 🌐 Network Audit

- **Objective:**  
  Examine the network infrastructure for vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and data flows.

- **Importance:**  
  Ensures proper segmentation, secure access, and detection of potential intrusions.

- **Example:**  
  Scanning for open ports, misconfigured firewalls, or unencrypted data transmissions.

---

> 📌 Tip: A strong security posture often includes a combination of these audits at regular intervals.

   
# 🛡️ Security Auditing & Penetration Testing

To operate effectively as a penetration tester, it's critical to understand how **security audits** are conducted — including **when**, **how**, and **why** they are performed — and how they **complement** or **differ** from penetration testing.

---

## 🔍 Security Audit vs. Penetration Test

| **Aspect**     | **Security Audit**                                                                 | **Penetration Test (Pentest)**                                                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**    | Ensure compliance, assess overall security posture, and evaluate internal controls. | Identify and exploit real-world vulnerabilities to understand potential impacts.    |
| **Scope**      | Broad: policies, processes, access control, configurations, documentation, etc.     | Narrow: targets specific systems or applications for exploitation.                  |
| **Methodology**| Review-based: interviews, checklists, configuration reviews, and control validation.| Simulation-based: ethical hacking, threat modeling, vulnerability exploitation.     |
| **Outcome**    | Compliance report, risk assessment, control evaluation, and improvement suggestions.| Proof-of-concept attacks, exploitation evidence, prioritized vulnerabilities.       |
| **Frequency**  | Regular (quarterly, annually), or triggered by compliance requirements.              | As needed (e.g., after major changes), typically annually or bi-annually.           |

## 🤝 Relationship Between Audit and Pentest

- **Complementary Activities**:  
  A **security audit** provides a holistic view of the organization's posture, while a **pentest** demonstrates how attackers could exploit specific weaknesses.

- **Audit First, Pentest Later**:  
  Security audits often uncover **policy or control issues** that should be addressed before conducting a pentest.

- **Both Are Crucial**:  
  To build a resilient security framework, organizations should conduct both **audits** and **penetration tests** regularly.


# 🔄 Sequential vs. Combined Security Testing Approaches

Organizations may choose different strategies to evaluate and improve their cybersecurity posture. The **Sequential Approach** involves conducting a **Security Audit first**, followed by a **Penetration Test**. Alternatively, a **Combined Approach** integrates both efforts for parallel insight.

---

## 🧭 Sequential Approach

### ✅ Perform Security Audit First:
Conducted to assess policies, processes, configurations, and compliance with standards.

### ✅ Conduct Penetration Test Afterwards:
Performed to simulate real-world attacks and exploit technical vulnerabilities identified in the audit.

---

### ✅ Advantages:

- Provides a **clear baseline** before testing exploitation.
- Helps **prioritize** pentest scope based on audit findings.
- Reduces **redundancy** by addressing known issues beforehand.

---

### ❌ Disadvantages:

- Can delay pentest execution.
- May lead to **overconfidence** if audit findings are assumed to fully represent the attack surface.
- Might **miss real-world exploit paths** if audit is too high-level.

---

## 🔁 Combined Approach

### 🔄 Integrate Security Audit and Pentest:
Security audit and penetration testing are performed in parallel or in a tightly coordinated manner.

---

### ✅ Advantages:

- **Holistic view** combining both process compliance and technical risk.
- Faster identification and remediation of **critical vulnerabilities**.
- Enables better **cross-team collaboration** between auditors and ethical hackers.

---

## 🧪 Example: Sequential Approach – "SecurePayments Inc."

**Background:**  
"SecurePayments Inc." is a fictional organization that processes credit card transactions and must comply with **PCI DSS standards**.

---

### 🧾 Security Audit Phase:

SecurePayments Inc. hired an independent audit firm to perform a full-scale security audit.

#### 🔎 Key Findings:

1. **Lack of encryption** for cardholder data in transit.
2. **Inadequate network security controls** and limited traffic monitoring.
3. **Weak access controls** on internal systems.

#### 📌 Audit Recommendations:

- Implement TLS 1.2+ encryption for all data transmissions.
- Deploy firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

---

## 🔐 Penetration Test Phase – SecurePayments Inc.

### 🔹 Phase 1: Planning and Preparation

- Define scope: Payment processing systems, web applications, and internal network.
- Obtain authorization and confirm timing with stakeholders.

**Objectives:**

- Validate the effectiveness of audit-based remediations.
- Identify exploitable vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios.
- Simulate external and internal attacker paths.

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Information Gathering & Reconnaissance

- Reviewed documentation on:
  - Access control policies
  - Encryption standards
  - Incident response procedures

- Performed passive reconnaissance:
  - DNS records
  - Public-facing IP ranges
  - Employee emails via open-source intelligence (OSINT)

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Pentest Execution

- Conducted network scanning using tools like **Nmap** and **Nessus**.
- Enumerated services and identified outdated software on internal servers.
- Exploited weak access control to gain unauthorized access to a test payment portal.
- Demonstrated potential MITM attack due to missing TLS on one subdomain.

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Findings and Recommendations

**Outcome:**

- Several systems still lacked proper encryption.
- Weak admin credentials were discovered in staging environments.
- Lateral movement was possible due to insufficient network segmentation.

**Recommendations:**

- Enforce TLS across all subdomains and APIs.
- Rotate all credentials and disable weak accounts.
- Implement network segmentation between development, staging, and production environments.

---

## 📌 Summary – Sequential Approach

The **Sequential Approach** allowed SecurePayments Inc. to:

- Use the **audit to uncover policy and configuration weaknesses**.
- Apply initial fixes before launching a **targeted pentest**.
- Gain **validation and deeper insight** through real-world attack simulations.
- Build a **prioritized roadmap** for long-term security improvements.
